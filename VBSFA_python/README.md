The python version of VBSFA using numpy and scipy

Well actually, I attempted to acheive the algorithm with the simplest way, hence I won't use any tricks like parallel computation....... This is not my coding style, I try to acheive all operator using tensor operation since we are handling dense data. Simply love, simply good. Best wishes!
